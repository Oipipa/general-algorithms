If a mismatch occurs _after_ $\\ell>0$ characters along an edge, we split that edge at distance $\\ell$, splice in a new internal node with a leaf for $s_i$, and continue the loop (`remainder--`).\n","\n","Each iteration that executes Rule 1 or 3 inserts exactly one _new_ leaf, so after all `remainder` iterations have terminated the tree contains every suffix of $S[0..i]$.  If at any point Rule 2 fires, we have shown that all remaining pending suffixes already appear in the tree, so the loop may end early.  Thus at the end of phase $i$ the tree $T_i$ satisfies the inductive claim.\n","\n","We charge every _constant‐time_ primitive (edge‐walk by one character, split, suffix‐link jump, comparison) to one of the following events:\n","\n","1.  **Splits**.  Each split creates a new internal node and can occur at most once per internal node.  Since there are at most $n-1$ internal nodes, splits contribute $O(n)$ total operations.\n","\n","2.  **Suffix‐link traversals**.  Every time we finish an extension at an internal node $u$, we follow its suffix link to a strictly _shorter_ path.  Each such jump shortens the active path by at least one character, and that active path can only grow when we first match a character on a leaf edge.  As there are at most $n$ leaf‐edge characters to match in total, the number of suffix‐link jumps is $O(n)$.\n","\n","3.  **Character comparisons / edge‐walks**.  Whenever we compare the next character $s_i$ against the tree we either  \n","   - succeed (increment the active‐length by one),  \n","   - cause a split (charged above), or  \n","   - invoke Rule 2 and break (one comparison).  \n","   Each successful comparison on a leaf edge can be charged to exposing one new character of that leaf, and there are only $n$ leaf‐edge characters in all phases.  Each failed comparison is either the single character that triggers a split (charged in 1) or the character that triggers Rule 2 and ends a phase.  There are at most $n$ such phase‐ending comparisons.  Hence all character comparisons total $O(n)$.\n","\n","4.  **Remainder‐updates and pointer‐adjustments**.  Each iteration of the while‐loop decrements `remainder` by one (except when Rule 2 breaks early).  Since we began with `remainder=0` and incremented it once per phase for $n$ phases, the total number of loop iterations is $O(n)$.  Updating the active point (either by moving the edge start forward or following the suffix link) costs $O(1)$ per iteration and so is $O(n)$ overall.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"_vKMLzjBFZA-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3\n","Describe and implement an algorithm for accepting $L_r$, the set of encodings of regular expressions $R$ such that $R$ denotes a nonempty set, which can be implemented on a linear-space-bounded DTM."],"metadata":{"id":"psj9Fd2bCEx0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def is_nonempty_regex(regex: str) -> bool:\n","    def is_operand(c):\n","        return c not in {'|', '*', '(', ')'}\n","\n","    out = []\n","    prev = None\n","    for c in regex:\n","        if prev is not None and (is_operand(prev) or prev in {')', '*'}) \\\n","                          and (is_operand(c) or c == '('):\n","            out.append('.')\n","        out.append(c)\n","        prev = c\n","    expr = ''.join(out)\n","\n","    # 2.

We construct a directed graph $G$ with $2n$ vertices corresponding to the $2n$ literals.  For each clause $(\\ell\\vee\\ell')$ we add the two implications\n","\n","$$\n","\\neg\\ell\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\ell',\n","\\quad\n","\\neg\\ell'\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\ell,\n","$$\n","\n","that is, we insert the arcs from the vertex for $\\neg\\ell$ to that for $\\ell'$, and from $\\neg\\ell'$ to $\\ell$.  Call the resulting digraph $G=(V,E)$.\n","\n","Two key facts underlie the algorithm.\n","\n","First, the original formula is satisfiable if and only if there exists a truth assignment that makes every clause true.  But a clause $(\\ell\\vee\\ell')$ fails exactly when both $\\ell$ and $\\ell'$ are false; in that case $\\neg\\ell$ and $\\neg\\ell'$ are both true, so from each of them the implication would force its target to be true as well.  Hence *no satisfying assignment exists* precisely when there is a variable $x_i$ for which both $x_i$ and $\\neg x_i$ must be true in every assignment consistent with the implications, i.e.\\ both vertices lie in the same strongly connected component of $G$.\n","\n","Second, if $G$ contains no strongly connected component that contains both $x_i$ and $\\neg x_i$, then one can topologically sort the condensation DAG of its strongly connected components.  Label each component by its position in a reverse post-order traversal.  In that order every edge of $G$ goes from a higher label to a lower label.  We then assign each variable $x_i$ the Boolean value\n","\n","$$\n","x_i = \\begin{cases}\n","\\text{True}, & \\text{if the component–label of }x_i\\text{ exceeds that of }\\neg x_i,\\\\\n","\\text{False},& \\text{otherwise.}\n","\\end{cases}\n","$$\n","\n","Because every implication $\\neg\\ell\\to\\ell'$ goes from a higher–labelled component to a lower, if $\\neg\\ell$ is assigned true then $\\ell'$ must also be assigned true.  Thus all clauses $(\\ell\\vee\\ell')$ are satisfied.  Conversely, if $x_i$ and $\\neg x_i$ belonged to the same component the algorithm would detect unsatisfiability immediately.\n","\n","To implement this in time polynomial in $n+m$, we proceed as follows.  Constructing the adjacency lists for $G$ uses $O(n+m)$ time and space.  Run a standard two-pass DFS (Kosaraju’s or Tarjan’s algorithm) in $O(|V|+|E|)=O(n+m)$ time to compute the strongly connected components and to record a reverse post-order of $G$.  Finally, test for each $i$ whether $x_i$ and $\\neg x_i$ lie in the same component; if so, report “unsatisfiable.”  Otherwise compute the assignment via the component labels in a single scan of all $n$ variables in $O(n)$ time.\n","\n","All steps—graph construction, two DFS traversals, component checks and final assignment—take $O(n+m)$ time overall, which is polynomial.  \n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"B_MqMpeb-Zh8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 5\n","The *one-dimensional package placement problem* is the following.  \n","Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph and $k$ a positive integer.  \n","Does there exist an ordering $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ for $V$ such that\n","$$\n","\\sum_{(v_i, v_j) \\in E} |i - j| \\le k ?\n","$$\n","\n","Show this problem to be NP-complete.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"zH4Cr1RN-789"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We prove that the **one‑dimensional package‑placement problem**\n","\n","$$\\text{1D‑PP}=\\Bigl\\{\\,\\langle G,k\\rangle\\ \\Bigm|\\ G=(V,E)\\text{ undirected},\n","\\ \\exists\\hbox{ ordering }v_1,\\dots ,v_{|V|}\\text{ with }\n","  \\sum_{(v_i,v_j)\\in E}|i-j|\\le k\\Bigr\\}$$  \n","\n","is NP‑complete.
