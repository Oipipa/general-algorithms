Choose a finite field $\\mathbb F_q$ with $q\\equiv1\\pmod n$ so that the multiplicative group $\\mathbb F_q^{\\times}$ contains an element $\\omega$ of order $n$.  For $a=(a_0,\\dots ,a_{n-1})\\in\\mathbb F_q^{\\,n}$ the length-$n$ Fourier transform is the vector $\\hat a$ with\n","\n","$$\\hat a_k=\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}a_j\\,\\omega^{kj}\\quad(0\\le k<n).$$\n","\n","Because $n$ is prime the set $\\{1,2,\\dots ,n-1\\}$ is cyclic under multiplication modulo $n$; let $g$ be a generator.  Every non-zero exponent can be written uniquely as $g^{\\ell}\\bmod n$ with $0\\le\\ell<n-1$.  Rewrite each non-trivial term of the transform:\n","\n","$$\n","\\hat a_k=a_0+\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{n-2}a_{g^{\\ell}}\\,\n","         \\omega^{k\\,g^{\\ell}}\n","\\;=\\;a_0+\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{n-2}\n","      A_\\ell\\,B_{k-\\ell},\n","$$\n","\n","where $A_\\ell=a_{g^{\\ell}}$ and $B_\\ell=\\omega^{g^{\\ell}}$.  Indices of $B$ are taken modulo $n-1$.  Thus the $n-1$ values $\\hat a_k$ for $k\\ge1$ are obtained by one **cyclic convolution**\n","\n","$$(A*B)_k=\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{n-2}A_\\ell\\,B_{k-\\ell\\;(\\mathrm{mod}\\;n-1)}.$$\n","\n","Cyclic convolution of length $m$ can be carried out through the convolution theorem once the field contains a primitive $m$-th root of unity.  Here $m=n-1$, which divides $q-1$ by construction, so $\\mathbb F_q$ possesses such a root, call it $\\zeta$.  Pad each vector with a single zero to length $m$ and form the degree-$m-1$ polynomials\n","\n","$$A(x)=\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{m-1}A_\\ell x^\\ell,\\qquad\n","  B(x)=\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{m-1}B_\\ell x^\\ell.$$\n","\n","Evaluate $A,B$ at the powers $\\zeta^0,\\zeta^1,\\dots ,\\zeta^{m-1}$ via the radix-2 Cooley–Tukey algorithm; $m$ is a power of $2$ because $n-1$ is even and any even number can be padded to the next power of $2$ by adding at most $m$ trailing zeros, which does not change asymptotics.  Each FFT of length $m$ uses $\\tfrac12 m\\log_2 m$ field multiplications and the same number of additions, so two forward FFTs and one inverse FFT cost\n","\n","$$\\tfrac32 \\,m\\log_2 m\\;=\\;O(m\\log m)=O((n-1)\\log n).$$\n","\n","Point-wise multiplication of the evaluation vectors contributes another $m=O(n)$ operations and is therefore absorbed by the same bound.  Recovering $\\hat a_k=(A*B)_k+a_0$ for $k\\ge1$ consumes $n-1$ additions, and $\\hat a_0=\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}a_j$ needs $n-1$ additions as well.\n","\n","Adding all contributions gives\n","\n","$$\n","T(n)=2(n-1)+O((n-1)\\log n)=O(n\\log n).\n","$$\n","\n","Because the field operations counted above are precisely the “steps” allowed in an algebraic model, the finite Fourier transform of prime length $n$ over $\\mathbb F_q$ is computable in $O_A(n\\log n)$ steps, where the constant hidden by $O_A$ is independent of $n$.  This meets the requirement and closes the proof that a prime-length finite Fourier transform admits the same asymptotic efficiency as its complex analogue.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0SXOLzn5Fgxe"}}]}
